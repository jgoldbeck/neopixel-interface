- Install satellite ccrma (login is ccrma:temppwd) (RPi 2 version still in development https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/satelliteccrma/ahiIMR_w4T4)
- Get internet working (for mac, try: https://galem.wordpress.com/2014/10/14/configuring-the-raspberry-pi-to-share-a-macs-internet-connection/ You can also do the DNS stuff on the Pi itself)

- comment out the blacklist spi-bcm2708 entry in /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf (if file exists)
- sudo raspi-config (advanced -> enable SPI. also maybe keyboard localization stuff) (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21028227/raspberry-pi-does-not-have-etc-modprobe-d-raspi-blacklist-conf)


- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install python-dev
(If dns doesn’t work right, this might help http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/128220/how-do-i-set-my-dns-on-ubuntu-14-04)

- Clone repo (git clone https://github.com/joegoldbeck/rainbow-starfish.git)
- sudo pip install twisted
- (in repo) sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
(if can’t find pip, “sudo apt-get install python-setuptools” then “sudo easy_install pip”)

- to start leds, in soundpuddle folder
./runPD.sh
./sparkle.py

(if have spi issues, try adding "dtparam=spi=on" to your config.txt and reboot. maybe raspi-config didn’t work.)

- to start leds on boot, add commands to /etc/rc.local to run on startup. add them before the ip stuff
example commands:
sudo -H -E -u ccrma screen -d -m -S py /home/ccrma/Source/rainbow-starfish/soundpuddle/sparklebike.py
sudo -H -E -u ccrma screen -d -m -S pd pd -nogui -audiodev 3 -channels 1 -nodac -audiobuf 15 /home/ccrma/Source/rainbow-starfish/soundpuddle/main.pd

OUTSTANDING ISSUES:
- adaptiveQuiet.py gets the error No Module Named Image
